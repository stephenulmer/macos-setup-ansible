# Ansible Role: ulmer.homebrew

**If you are looking for a role that manages Homebrew to use in production, use geerlingguy.homebrew instead. That's what I do.**

## History 

This is the very first role I ever attempted. 

I used the configuration of my Mac as a pet project to learn Ansible. The management of Homebrew was, unsurprisingly, one of the first functions to be factored out.

At that time I was already aware of Jeff Geerling's fine work, but writing something from scratch is the best way to learn. Note that this role makes an effort to use the same configuration variables and paradigms as geerlingguy.homebrew. I intend to be able to abstract the role name and use either interchangeably.
